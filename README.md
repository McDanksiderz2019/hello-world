# hello-world
As a zen main I love hitting people with balls, my zen balls of course.  As such I am here to show that even if I am the easiest hero to kill, I will go down throwing, my balls.  You will feel their fury as I suck your soul out with my discord orb.  And as you die, all you will hear is me spamming Hello World while tea-bagging you.
That being said, I no longer wish to be toxic anymore, I just want to be happy.  As I sit here floating, I ask myself, "Who are you if who you are is you are who".  This very question should terrify even the basic of man.  The answer is not as simple though.  If you are who then the question becomes "I am you if I you are is you are I".  Now this makes no sense, or does it.  See the statement must be rewritten. It goes "I am you if you are I, is you I?"  Yes the statement was always a question but what does the question mean.  The person in question is asking the other person if they are like them, but it goes deeper than this.  The person asking the question is not a person, but a group of people.  As such the question is asking if one joins the group and becomes one being or do they stand out as an individual.  A tale as old as time, collectivism versus individualism.  This is why the question scares mankind.
